I've decided to build a mimic panel for my layout which would need to include a throttle capable of controlling multiple trains concurrently.

After seeing various different throttle projects and ideas shared in the DCC-EX team's Discord server, and building one of the team's hand held WiFi/WiThrottle based controllers, I decided to go with some mouse wheel rotary encoders for throttle control, a standard 4 x 3 keypad for input duties, and a 1.3" SPI OLED display for output. This will connect to my EX-CommandStation via serial cable as it will be fixed to the side of my layout, although I will likely add support for an ESP32 and WiFi at a later date.

.. warning:: 

  This project was formerly called "dcc-ex-serial-throttle" but has been renamed as DCCEXTriThrottle is more appropriate. It also previously used slide potentiometers for input, hence the photos being out of date rather than showing mouse wheel rotary encoders.

  The microcontroller is in the process of being moved to an STMicroelectronics Bluepill rather than the Nano as it was running out of memory.

  This project is undergoing a major re-write and therefore I have temporarily removed all documentation until the new direction is at least useable.

There is also a quick and dirty video available on `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzAAL3OKxE0>`_.

.. Hardware
.. ========

.. The brains of the throttle are an Arduino Nano clone, and the software is available in GitHub (see :ref:`serial-throttle/index:software`).

.. For the throttle inputs, I'm using `Duinotech brand 10K linear slide potentiometers <https://www.jaycar.com.au/duinotech-10k-ohm-slider-potentiometer-module/p/XC3734?pos=3&queryId=ef2bae5db0b425b82c157b0774288151&sort=relevance>`_ sourced locally here from Jaycar Electronics , however any 10K linear slide or rotary potentiometers will work. In fact, I have also assembled another throttle for my test setup which uses three 10K linear rotary potentiometers to save space.

.. For the display, I'm also using a `Duinotech brand 1.3" 128 x 64 monochrome SPI OLED <https://www.jaycar.com.au/duinotech-1-3-inch-monochrome-oled-display/p/XC3728?pos=1&queryId=7acf08343c86584d30569e8c38014c92&sort=relevance>`_ also sourced from Jaycar Electronics . For my test setup, I'm using a smaller generic 0.96" 128 x 64 I2C OLED display sourced from eBay. Any equivalent SPI or I2C based OLED display with 128 x 64 resolution should suffice.

.. The `4x3 kepad <https://www.jaycar.com.au/12-key-numeric-keypad/p/SP0770?pos=2&queryId=b8b9b8588af031e994c61d38f57ccc50&sort=relevance>`_ is also (surprisingly) sourced from Jaycar Electronics. I much prefer the feel of these keypads over the membrane type, however any 4 x 3 keypad should suffice.

.. Panel design
.. ============

.. The panel was designed using Fusion360 and then printed on my Creality Ender 3V2 printer. I haven't shared the file in Thingiverse as it's pretty specific to my application, and will only work with the specific components sourced from Jaycar. I'm more than happy to share if there is interest though.

.. Software
.. ========

.. The software for the throttle is available in my `DCCEXTriThrottle GitHub repository <https://github.com/peteGSX-Projects/DCCEXTriThrottle>`_.

.. The aim of the software is to use native DCC-EX API integration to control the various aspects of my layout, including concurrent control of three locomotives, and eventuallyl being able to initiate automated routes and close/throw turnouts. Given the throttle will be physically mounted on my mimic panel, operating turnouts and my turntable are very low priorities for the throttle.

.. Right now, the software is very much a work-in-progress and is extremely limited. The loco addresses are currently hard coded.

.. The immediate plans I will be implementing when time allows are:

.. - Enable manually entering locomotive addresses via the keypad
.. - Enable reading the roster entries from the DCC-EX EX-CommandStation for selection via the keypad

.. Throttle usage instructions
.. ===========================

.. (Note as per above that locomotive addresses are currently hardcoded)

.. The table below outlines the current keypad functions.

.. Keys listed with an asterisk (*) mean they key needs to be held down for half a second or more, all other key presses are momentary.
